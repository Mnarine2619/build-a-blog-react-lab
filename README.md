# React Parent-Child Lab

In this lab, you'll create componentize a website mockup.

## Getting started

To get started, clone this repository into the CS50 IDE:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/upperlinecode/react-parent-child-lab
```

> Note: if you have other React projects in CS50, you may run out of allocated memory. If that happens, we recommend deleting the `node_modules/` folder of other projects to free up some space.

Then switch into the project directory, and install the node modules:

```bash
# switch into the project directory
cd react-parent-child-lab

# install the node modules
npm install
```

Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server using:

```bash
npm start
```

## To Do's

We will be converting the code in `App.js` into functional components.
